        Overview The aim of this module is to allow students to
        conduct primary research (with secondary research support) in a topic
        area relevant to their degree title. Students are expected to design,
        implement and critically evaluate a functional or simulated system,
        object or concept and to acquire further knowledge of a specialist
        technical area. To this end, students will undertake a substantial
        project which will exercise the in-depth technical, problem-solving,
        creative and other skills required of a professional practitioner.
        Students will be required to ensure that their work conforms to
        appropriate codes of practice and meets the ethical requirements of the
        University. Successful completion of the project will require methodical
        planning, record keeping and self-management and effective
        communication, execution and delivery of an agreed artefact. Support and
        guidance will be provided by a project supervisor who will be the
        primary point of contact for a student on this module.
